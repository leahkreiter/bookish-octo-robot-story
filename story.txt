	Leah is a computer engineering student at UW Madison.  In her free time on campus, she likes to go out with her friends, find new coffee shops, and sleep when she is not studying. Leah's favorite part about her classes are her ECE classes, she really wants to do assembly code as part of her future career. 

However, one day, she took a new course related to digital photography, and she found it was more interesting to take photos than coding. She changed her idea. She no longer wanted to be a computer engineer, instead she decided to be a photographer.
